To reproduce the model in our paper, one can run [R/survival_analysis.R](R/survival_analysis.R). `survival_analysis.R` reads data from 
`surv_data.csv`, which one can obtain by downloading and upzipping [data/surv_data_anonymized.csv.zip](data/surv_data_anonymized.csv.zip) and saving it in the
same directory as the file `survival_analysis.R`.
